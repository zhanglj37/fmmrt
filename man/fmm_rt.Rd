\title{Bayesian Factor Mixture Model with Response Time}
\usage{
fmm_rt(
  responses,
  rt,
  iter = 10000,
  burnin = 5000,
  save.file = TRUE,
  seed = 123
)
}
\arguments{
\item{responses}{A numeric matrix of item responses with rows representing respondents
and columns representing items.}

\item{rt}{A numeric matrix of response times with the same dimensions as \code{responses}.
Response times are internally log transformed.}

\item{iter}{Total number of MCMC iterations.}

\item{burnin}{Number of burn in iterations.}

\item{save.file}{Logical indicating whether to save a CSV file
containing classification results and original data.}

\item{seed}{Random seed for reproducibility.}
}
\value{
A list with the following elements:
\itemize{
  \item epsr Maximum potential scale reduction factor across monitored parameters.
  \item estimates Posterior summaries including means, quantiles, and HPD intervals.
  \item probability A data frame containing posterior probabilities of being attentive
  and binary group classification for each respondent.
}
}
\description{
Fit a Bayesian factor mixture model that jointly models item responses
and response times to classify respondents into attentive and careless groups.
The model is estimated using JAGS and returns parameter estimates,
convergence diagnostics, and posterior classification probabilities.
}
\details{
The model assumes two latent classes representing attentive and careless respondents.
Item responses are modeled using a factor analytic structure for the attentive group
and a reduced structure for the careless group.
Response times are modeled jointly to improve classification.
