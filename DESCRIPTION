Title: Bayesian Factor Mixture Modeling with Response Time
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Lijin Zhang
Maintainer: Lijin Zhang <lijin.zhang@stanford.edu>
Description: Implements a Bayesian factor mixture model that jointly models
    item responses and response times to identify attentive and careless
    respondents. The package fits a two class mixture model using JAGS,
    combining a factor analytic response model with a response time model
    to improve classification and parameter estimation in survey data.
